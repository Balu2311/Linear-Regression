# Linear-Regression
In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach for modeling the relationship between a scalar dependent variable y and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables) denoted X. In this example, we consider only one feature, #number_hours_studied, against the output #marks_scored for a given data set. The algorithm basically calculates the hypothesis which best fits the given data set
